# Opinions of movies by non-experts

## Pitch:
My unit2 project will be a movies website where users can create an account, login their and comment their opinion the the movies displayed on the website that they've watched before. They will be able to edit and delete comments if they would like and choose their favorite movies.

## API
I will be using the OMDB API. I have a key already.


## User Stories
As a user I would like to safely create an account, see different movies, be able to add my opinion of movies I've watched (as comments), edit or delete it if necessary and choose my favorites.

## Stretch Goals
